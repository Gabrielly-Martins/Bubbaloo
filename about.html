            <div class="about"><h2>The History of <strong>Bubbaloo</strong> </h2></div>

            <p>Bubbaloo, a product beloved by all audiences, went from a shelved project in 1970 to a major success in the chewing gum market.
            The gum, launched in 1984 by the Brazilian division of the English company Adams, changed the chewing gum market before and after
            its creation.</p>

            <p>Launched in the tutti-frutti flavor, in addition to its innovative shape and texture for the time, the chewing gum created
            enormous bubblegum balls and contained a delightful liquid inside. These factors caught the attention of the population and
            influenced the product to become the market leader, a position it still holds today.
            The promotion of Bubbaloo was extensive, using the slogan created by Gugu Liberato,<b>'The new generation of bubble gum.'</b> The
            product appeared everywhere, from local retail outlets to even major television programs.</p>

            <p>In 1987, just a few years after its successful launch in Brazil, the brand, recognizing significant potential in the product,
            decided to introduce Bubbaloo to the Spanish market. </p>

            <p>A few years later, in 1991, the company Adams decided it was time to innovate. They created another flavor for the gum, different
            from what was already on the market. Now, Bubbaloo could offer another taste in addition to tutti-frutti and strawberry, Bubbaloo
            banana was launched. Using the slogan<b>'Nothing is tastier than a Bubbaloo banana'</b>, their marketing campaign was targeted
            towards a younger audience. The great success of the new flavor led the brand to continue innovating with new flavors throughout
            the 90s, such as grape, watermelon, tangerine, and green apple. These were considered responsible for the record market share of
            the Bubbaloo brand.</p>

            <p>With the aim of captivating its customers, Bubbaloo decided to create a rotation of its sold flavors, ensuring that its customers
            would always have something new. The flavors tutti-frutti, strawberry, grape, mint, and fruit salad were sold year-round, and at
            least twice a year, two new flavors were launched, some of them unusual.</p>

            <p>At the beginning of the millennium, Adams was acquired by the traditional English company Cadbury, enabling the brand to
            continue innovating in its products</p>

            <p>A few years later, in 2010, Cadbury was acquired by the American company Kraft Foods, and Bubbaloo became part of the brand's
            portfolio. Later, it was divided into two parts: Kraft Foods Group (United States) and Mondelēz International (owner of brands in
            candies, chewing gum, chocolates, cookies, and snacks in the international market).</p>

            its irresistible flavors and occasional innovations that emerge in the market. Undoubtedly, it has been delightful to witness the
            growth of this brand.</p>
